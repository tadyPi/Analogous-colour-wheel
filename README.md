# Analogous-colour-wheel, using HTML CSS and Javascript.

The term analogous refers to having analogy, or corresponding to something in particular.

These color schemes are most often seen in nature. 

For example, during the fall, one might often see the changing leaves form an analogous sort of color scheme,
progressively moving through the color wheel to create a gradient in its natural pattern.
